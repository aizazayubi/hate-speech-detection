# Hate Speech Detection for Low-Resource Languages

After developing the first-ever Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for **Khowar** and **Pashto**, we are now working on a **Hate Speech Detection** model for these low-resource languages.

The system processes spoken input, converts it into text using our ASR pipelines, and then analyzes the transcribed content to detect and classify hate speech. This approach enables automated monitoring and analysis for languages that are largely underserved in current NLP research.

## Key Objectives
- Support low-resource languages
- Detect and classify hate speech from speech and text
- Promote safer and more inclusive digital spaces

## Workflow
1. Audio input from user  
2. Language identification (Khowar / Pashto)  
3. Speech-to-text transcription  
4. Hate speech detection and classification  
5. Output: Hate / Non-hate content
